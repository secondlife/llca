# Second Life Certificate Authority Store

This repository stores the public certificates for those Certificate
Authorities we have chosen to distribute bundled with the Second Life
Viewer.

We have created this collection using the
[Mozilla CA Certificate Store](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/security-group/certs/).
